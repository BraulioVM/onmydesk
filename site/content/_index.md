  text: Managing affiliate links is hard. Even more so if you want to point your
    audience to their favorite store. Some of your subscribers love Amazon, some
    love Thomann and some others love Reverb. Say goodbye to painstakingly
    accumulating links for all the stores.

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
