  heading: Affiliate links made easy
  text: Managing affiliate links can be hard. Even more so if you want to make
    them work for your whole audience. Some of your Australian subscribers want
    to shop on Amazon.au, some of your German subscribers want to shop on
    Thomann.de, and some of your American subscribers want to shop on Reverb.
    Just tell us what products you are promoting and your affiliate tags for the
    stores you care about and we will do the rest.

    stores that you want to support. Finally, we work 24/7 to ensure that your
    audience finds their way to their favorite store when clicking on the links.

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
